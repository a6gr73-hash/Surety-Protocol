It's 3:14 PM. No problem at allâ€”getting used to Git is a journey, and IntelliJ has excellent built-in Git tools that can make it much easier over time.

For now, here is the complete project brief we've built. This document is the culmination of our entire design process and can serve as the foundational "blueprint" in your new /docs folder.

Project Brief: The Surety Protocol (SRT)
1. Objective
To create a highly scalable, decentralized payment protocol that provides instant, economically guaranteed transactions for merchants, enabling stablecoins to be used for global commerce at a scale and efficiency greater than legacy payment rails like Visa.

2. Core Philosophy
"Assume Malice, Prove Innocence": Prioritizes network liveness by assuming transaction failures are malicious by default.

"Silent, Automated Recovery": Provides a seamless user experience where network faults are automatically and invisibly resolved by an incentivized Watcher network without requiring user action.

3. Key Innovations (The "Moat")
Instant Economic Finality: The protocol's core innovation. Merchant transactions are instantly insured by the sender's 110% slashable collateral, eliminating settlement risk and enabling true, risk-free point-of-sale functionality.

Two-Tiered Architecture: A network of high-throughput shards for instant, collateralized payments, anchored by a highly secure Beacon Chain for final settlement.

Price-Aware Economics: Core protocol costs (validator stake, watcher budget) are pegged to USD via oracles, ensuring long-term economic stability and predictability.

4. Network Architecture
Consensus Layer: A single Beacon Chain responsible for managing the validator set, finalizing shard states, and serving as the ultimate court of arbitration.

Execution Layer: A dynamic set of parallel processing Shards where user transactions occur.

Consensus Engine: A Proof-of-Stake model based on Ethereum's Gasper (LMD GHOST + Casper FFG), to be implemented by forking and adapting a battle-tested, open-source client (e.g., Lighthouse/Rust or Prysm/Go).

5. Network Participants (The Participation Pyramid)
Validators: Professional node operators who produce blocks and secure the network.

Watchers: Professional service providers who monitor for failed transactions and initiate the recovery process.

Auditors (V2): Community members running light nodes on consumer hardware to detect and report validator fraud.

Delegators: Token holders who lend their stake to validators to help secure the network and earn rewards.

Users: Transact on the network, primarily using stablecoins for payments.

6. Core Smart Contracts
The on-chain logic is managed by ~7 core smart contract suites on the Beacon Chain:

Surety (SRT) Token: The ERC20 contract for the native asset.

Staking: Manages validator and delegator funds and status.

Slashing: Enforces validator penalties.

Treasury: Manages all protocol revenue and expenditures.

PoI Verifier: Verifies dispute claims from Watchers.

Governance: The DAO contracts for protocol management.

Oracle Aggregator: Provides the secure SPP/USD price feed.

7. Tokenomics ($SRT)
Utility: The SRT token is used for Staking, Gas, and Governance.

Commerce Model: The protocol acts as the "rails" for third-party stablecoins (like USDC), which serve as the primary medium of exchange.

Supply: 1 Billion SRT (Fixed, Pre-minted).

Sustainability: The Treasury is funded by network transaction fees and is designed to be self-sustaining in the long term, paying for all security costs (staking rewards, watcher retainers, etc.) from its revenue.

8. Development Roadmap
V1 Goal (Solo Founder): Build a Proof-of-Concept MVP to Secure Funding.

MVP Definition: Working core contracts on a public testnet, a minimal single-chain client, and a live demo of the Watcher/PoI "silent recovery" loop.

Post-Funding: Hire a core team, implement the full sharding architecture, undergo professional security audits, and launch the V1 mainnet.

V2 & Beyond (Post-Launch Upgrades):

2.0: Auditor System & Fraud Proofs.

2.1: Integrated Liquid Staking Standard.
